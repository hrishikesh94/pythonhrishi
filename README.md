I have included few statistical analysis results on ACC cement chart details, that i could scrape off the Techpaisa Servers. 
The ACC cement details go back to 1990s. So it is important I log the data into a CSV file (Read Code)

There are several other factors and statistical formulaes, parameters that can help one understand the best stock in the current
market. I have no idea how to think about a company's finances and its corporate actions and use the details to understand the
stock market, so i prefer the Mathematical method of analysis.



This is a hobby! I dont wish to harm Techpaisa. 
Anyone else who wishes to use the code, ensure you arent violating any interests of the website and use it at your own risk!
